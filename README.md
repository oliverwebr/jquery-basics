# jQuery Basics

## Task Scope

Imagine this template as a finished webpage you can not edit the HTML or the CSS of this page. You can only edit the Javascript part. Use as much jQuery as possible to support older Browsers.

## Tasks

1.  Each project can just be clicked on the link we want that we can click on the project div to checkout the project
2.  when we hover a project we want that it grows a bit with a nice animation
3.  Add a cookie consent banner
4.  Replace project image placeholder with random images from https://unsplash.com/
5.  When you click on a project a modal with project content should fade in.
